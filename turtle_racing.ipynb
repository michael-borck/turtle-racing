        "\n",
        "The game is won by the person whose turtle arrives at its home first.\n",

        "* Each player takes turns rolling a die\n",
        "* The player moves their turtle by 10 time the die number of steps\n",

        "> Keep the initial interface to a simple text-based interface.  But think about how you might use forms or widgets to run the game.\n"
